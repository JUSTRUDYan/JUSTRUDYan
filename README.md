~~Hi, my name is Anton~~
Whats up, I probably need to describe my personalyty here. XD 

I will try to write a poem about myself as Taras Shevchenko, in my broken English.

What you need to know about me : I'm Anton, 3 years old and i from Ukrain ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.
//I also hate to read the morning news â€˜cause it always makes me sad, you know, many people died because of russian invasion. Please, support Ukraine!//

I start coding at 10 o'clock and compleat after 15 minuts, because my brain suck's.

////

But seriously I'm 13 yo, and i start coding at 10, it was python, but quickly finished it, because I got bored.
After 3 years I went to an academy that gave me a love for .cpp. (but that love ends very quickly when my code doesn't run)
Also in academy i'm studying cyber security, and i like that too.

If you want to talk with me about smth (pls don't do this if you don't want to hear my english)

Break a lag and bye bye.
